                It's made a spluttering sort of start in Test cricket: Rohit missed three
            of India's five Tests since he became their all-format captain. Injuries,
            in fact, have forced Rohit to miss eight of India's last 10 Test matches.   
            He was Player of the Match in India's last Test before this stretch of
            games, a landmark victory that took them to a 2-1 series lead in
            England, months after they had beaten Australia 2-1 in Australia

                Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is set to miss the first Test
                against India in Nagpur with an Achilles niggle in his left leg,
                and is doubtful for the second Test in Delhi as well.

                Australia are prepared for moments where batting could become
                chaotic against India, but will also enter the series with an open mind
                amid all the talk about the role spin could play.
